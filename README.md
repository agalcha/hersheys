# Welcome to Harshita's Git🦋

Hey there! I’m Harshita, a curious coder, AI tinkerer, and occasional doodle enthusiast💁🏻‍♀️.  

🎨I love to draw to get things off my chest when life gets too overwhelming.  
👯I love socializing and making new friends.  
✨I'm super organized & detail-oriented because life’s better when things are just right.  
👩🏻‍💻I'm also a CS student majoring in Artificial Intelligence!!  

Right now, I’m leveling up my coding superpowers:  
🤖 Building AI agents  
🧠 Creating machine learning models  
💡 Experimenting with clever tech that makes computers a little smarter (and me a lot sharper!)  

I also love being part of creative, innovative teams:  
NAT (Network for Applied Technology): merging learning with innovation 🚀  
Mission Spacewalker: an all-women research team taking on the CAN-RGX competition 🌌
